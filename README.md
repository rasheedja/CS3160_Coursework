# CS3160 Coursework

## Importing the database
Instructions are for Ubuntu 16.04
- You can either modify the project to use a different database, OR you can import the database currently used by the project by following the instructions below

--------------------

- Ensure you have mysql-client and mysql-server installed
- Login to the mysql client
- `CREATE USER 'rasheeja'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mome34show';`
- `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'rasheeja'@'localhost'`
- Import `coursework_db_2017_modified.sql` using the command line or a GUI of your choice

## Sections Completed
I have completed all optional and compulsory sections. I created a calendar using the fullCalendar library for the last task.
